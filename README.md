A brief description of your project and its purpose.

Features
Todo List: Users can add, delete, and view tasks.

Image Display: The app displays an image of the day retrieved from Unsplash.
Email Notifications: The app can send email notifications with daily updates including the todo list, weather data, and image.

## Description

This project is a web app built using F# and Giraffe for the backend, with the frontend developed using Fable or JavaScript libraries like React. The app allows users to manage a todo list, view real-time weather data, and see a daily image. The weather data is fetched from Open-Meteo, and the image comes from Unsplash, both of which provide free API access. Additionally, the app sends daily email notifications with updates about the todo list, weather, and the image of the day. The app ensures security by storing sensitive information like API keys and email credentials in a configuration file, not hard-coded in the code. This project also follows best practices in version control using Git, with regular commits and a well-structured codebase.
